### Rayaan Hassan - Securing 5G networks with Federated Learning and GANs - HelSec Meetup October 2023

#### 5G network

- 5G has three phases: Radio Access Network, Core Network and End Points
- 5G is all software in the cloud
- We are not using full potential of 5G, not been fully launched and not complete NFV
- Rise in IoT devices
- High data rates and low latency
- 5G core is really well made

#### Threats

- Attacks are really sofisticated
- Most common attacks are end point and access points network attacks

#### Securing 5G network

- Machine learning and Deep learning centralizes all the data in one place
- Federated learning distribute the machine learning process such a way that the machine learning model is basically trained on the end devices itself and the data never actually leaves the device.
