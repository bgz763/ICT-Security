# Read and summarize

In Chapter 1 of Adam Shostack's book "Threat Modeling: Designing for Security," the author introduces the concept of threat modeling and emphasizes its importance in the field of cybersecurity. Shostack encourages readers to dive into the practice of threat modeling by providing a hands-on approach.

He outlines the key components of threat modeling, which involve identifying assets, understanding the system's architecture, and analyzing potential threats and vulnerabilities. Shostack also emphasizes the need for a structured approach to threat modeling, which involves defining the scope, building a model, and then analyzing and prioritizing potential threats.

Overall, Chapter 1 serves as an introductory chapter that lays the foundation for the rest of the book, providing readers with a clear understanding of the significance of threat modeling and offering practical advice on how to get started.

# Treath model for imaginary company TelcoX

## (1) What are we working on?

TelcoX is an imaginary telco company aiming to provide advanced telecommunications services to its customers. The services include mobile and network solutions, data security, Virtual PBX, VoIP, IoT and data center serivices. The business is committed to delivering reliable, high-quality services while maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of customer data.

TelcoX handles sensitive customer information such as personal identification details, billing information, and communication records. Additionally, the company maintains critical infrastructure for its services including data centers, network equipment, and customer support systems.

Business Requirements:

- Deliver high-quality telecommunications services

- Protect customer data and privacy

- Maintain network availability and reliability

- Offer innovative value-added services

- Ensure compliance with regulatory standards and industry best practices

Technical Specialist Input:

- Network design and configuration

- Security protocols and technologies

- Data encryption and authentication mechanisms

Key assets prioritization:

- Personal identification information

- Billing information

- Communication records

- Network infrastructure

- Customer support systems

## (2) What can go wrong?

Attackers may attempt to:

- Gain unauthorized access to customer databases to steal personal information.

- Perform DDoS attacks on critical network infrastructure.

- Exploit vulnerabilities in customer support systems for unauthorized access.

- Launch phishing campaigns targeting employees for sensitive information.

- Tamper with billing systems to commit fraud.

- Exploit software vulnerabilities in network equipment.

Examples of identified risks:

1. Unauthorized Access: Attackers attempting to gain unauthorized access to sensitive databases.

2. DDoS Attacks: Disruption of services due to large-scale DDoS attacks.

3. Social Engineering: Phishing attacks targeting employees for credentials or sensitive information.

4. Insider Threats: Employees with malicious intent accessing and leaking customer data.

5. Interconnected networks: Interconnected networks and abundant customer data make it an attractive target for cyber criminals, who can cause significant damage with minimal effort. Infiltration can lead to access to information on various connected systems.

6. Legacy technology: The sector still relies on legacy technology, making it vulnerable to IP-based threats. Slow adoption of advanced technology leaves companies with outdated, susceptible systems.

7. Increasing threat surface: The introduction of advanced technology like 5G expands the threat surface.

8. Lack of awareness: A lack of technical knowledge and awareness among the team leads to poor password hygiene and risky data sharing practices, which could be mitigated with proper education.

9. Supply Chain Risks: The reliance on third-party vendors, such as web hosting services and managed service providers, exposes the industry to potential vulnerabilities. Weak cybersecurity measures within these vendors can provide hackers with an entry point into the telecom network.

10. Internet of Things (IoT) Risks: The growing adoption of IoT devices has expanded the threat surface. Many of these connected devices lack adequate security measures, leading to vulnerabilities like system weaknesses and weak passwords.

11. Cloud Threats: While cloud computing is increasingly used to support operations, it is not immune to security concerns. A successful attack on a cloud network can impact multiple virtual machines simultaneously, posing a severe risk.

12. DNS Attacks: In 2019, a significant percentage of telecom and media companies experienced DNS attacks. These attacks are costly, with affected companies potentially losing millions of dollars per incident.

13. SS7 and Diameter Signaling Threats: Protocols like SS7 and Diameter, used by many telecom companies, have vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploiting these vulnerabilities can gain unauthorized access to user accounts and steal information. Some companies fail to implement the necessary controls, leaving their systems susceptible to breaches.

(Mariano 2022; Mohamed & Barlow 2021.)

## (3) What are we going to do about it?

1. Reduce Attack Surface: Implement strict access controls, strong authentication, and encryption protocols.

2. Limit Entry Points: Employ firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regularly patch systems.

3. Employee Training: Conduct regular security awareness training to mitigate social engineering risks.

4. Monitoring and Detection: Implement real-time monitoring for unusual activities and deploy threat detection tools.

5. Backup and Recovery: Regularly back up critical data and have robust recovery procedures in place.

6. Collaborate with cybersecurity experts and stay updated on industry trends.

7. Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

8. Create an incident response plan and conduct drills to test its effectiveness.

(Utilitiesone 2023.)

## (4) Did we do a good enough job?

- Security Audits and Assessments: Regularly conduct security audits and assessments to identify and rectify vulnerabilities.

- Penetration Testing: Engage third-party experts to perform penetration testing to identify weaknesses.

- Continuous Threat Modeling: Regularly update the threat model to adapt to evolving threats and technologies.

- Incident Response Plan: Have a well-defined incident response plan in place to handle security incidents effectively.

# Analyzing DDoS incident with Cyber Kill Chain framework

The cyber kill chain framework, introduced by Lockheed Martin in 2011, is a widely-used model for understanding and analyzing cyber attacks. It breaks down the stages of a cyber attack into seven steps: Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and Control (C2), and Actions on Objectives.

When applying the cyber kill chain framework to analyze a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) incident, you can use the following approach:

Reconnaissance: Identify if there was any reconnaissance phase in the DDoS incident. This could involve the attacker gathering information about the target network, such as IP addresses, domain names, or vulnerabilities.

Weaponization: Determine how the attacker weaponized the DDoS attack. This could involve the creation or acquisition of tools or scripts that were used to launch the attack.

Delivery: Understand how the DDoS attack was delivered to the target. This could involve methods such as sending a large volume of network packets, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using amplification techniques.

Exploitation: In the context of DDoS, exploitation refers to the attacker's ability to leverage a vulnerability or a flaw in the target's network infrastructure to magnify the impact of the attack.

Installation: Determine if the attacker needed to install any additional software or make any configurations to facilitate the DDoS attack. This could include setting up botnets or deploying additional attack infrastructure.

Command and Control (C2): Analyze if the attacker had a mechanism for controlling and coordinating the DDoS attack. This could involve the use of command and control servers or other communication channels.

Actions on Objectives: Understand the ultimate goal of the DDoS attack. Was it solely to disrupt services, or was it part of a larger campaign with specific objectives, such as diversion for another attack or extortion?
By systematically examining each stage of the cyber kill chain in the context of the DDoS incident, you can gain a deeper understanding of how the attack was executed and potentially identify areas where defenses could be strengthened to prevent or mitigate future incidents. Keep in mind that the effectiveness of this analysis will depend on the availability of data and logs related to the DDoS incident.
