### Read and summarize

#### Shavers & Bair 2016

The Tor browser, derived from Firefox, enables anonymous internet use by concealing the user's IP address. It was developed by the US government in 2002, aiming to facilitate unrestricted, private communication. Tor operates by directing internet traffic through random relays, employing elliptic curve cryptography for encryption. Its global network, managed by volunteers, boasts over 750,000 users. While the Tor browser is user-friendly, its anonymity also attracts illicit use. Tracking Tor users is challenging due to its complex routing and encryption. Government efforts to deanonymize Tor exist, but success often relies on user errors or combining Tor with other tools.

#### Quintin 2014

The article emphasizes key points about the Tor network. Firstly, despite NSA leaks, Tor remains effective in providing anonymity, with no evidence of cryptographic compromise. Secondly, Tor's user base is diverse, including activists, military, families, and journalists, dispelling the misconception that it is solely for criminals. Thirdly, there is no military backdoor in Tor, having been audited for security. Fourthly, running a Tor relay is legal in the US, with no reported prosecutions. The fifth point highlights Tor's ease of use through the Tor Browser Bundle or Tails. While Tor is slower than regular internet, ongoing efforts aim to improve its speed. Lastly, Tor is not foolproof; users must use it correctly to maintain anonymity, keeping software updated and being mindful of potential adversaries.

### a) Compare anonymous/pseudonymous networks

#### Tor (The Onion Router):
Goal: Tor aims to provide anonymity by routing traffic through a series of volunteer-operated nodes, encrypting data at each step.

Technology: Tor uses a layered encryption approach (onion routing) and a decentralized network of volunteer nodes. The data is encrypted in layers, and each node only decrypts one layer to reveal the next hop.

Other Features: Tor Browser enhances privacy by blocking browser fingerprinting and disabling certain web features that could compromise anonymity.

(Tor 2023; Wherry 2023.)

#### I2P (Invisible Internet Project):
Goal: I2P focuses on providing a platform for building anonymous applications and aims to create a network where users can communicate and share information without revealing their identities.

Technology: I2P uses a garlic routing technique where multiple messages are encrypted together in a single "garlic" packet, making it harder to trace individual messages.

Other Features: I2P offers integrated services like general browsing, instant messaging, file storing, and website hosting.

(I2P 2023; Ilevičius 2023.)

#### Freenet:
Goal: Freenet aims to provide censorship-resistant communication and content sharing by distributing data across a decentralized network of nodes.

Technology: Freenet uses a distributed data store and content is stored on nodes based on popularity, making it resistant to censorship.

Other Features: Freenet supports the creation of "freesites," which are websites hosted on the Freenet network.

(Hyphanet 2023; Srivathsav 2018.)

#### ZeroNet:
Goal: ZeroNet aims to create a decentralized and censorship-resistant web platform using Bitcoin cryptography and BitTorrent technology.

Technology: ZeroNet uses blockchain and BitTorrent principles to distribute websites across users' machines, eliminating the need for traditional web hosting.

Other Features: ZeroNet websites are updated and maintained by users, and content is stored locally.

(ZeroNet 2023; Srivathsav 2018.)

#### RetroShare:
Goal: RetroShare focuses on private communication and file sharing among a network of trusted friends.

Technology: RetroShare uses a friend-to-friend (F2F) network, and all communication is encrypted using OpenSSL. It employs a distributed hash table (DHT) for friend discovery.

Other Features: RetroShare includes forums, channels, and private chat options for users.

(Retroshare 2023.)

#### Whisper (Ethereum):
Goal: Whisper provides a decentralized messaging system on the Ethereum blockchain to enable communication without revealing identities.

Technology: Whisper uses a decentralized peer-to-peer messaging protocol within the Ethereum network.

Other Features: Messages in Whisper are encrypted, and the protocol supports both public and private communication.

(Longinotti 2022.)

#### GNUnet:
Goal: GNUnet aims to provide a secure, decentralized framework for peer-to-peer networking.

Technology: GNUnet uses a mix of peer-to-peer technologies, including distributed hash tables (DHT), to create a secure and privacy-preserving network.

Other Features: GNUnet supports various applications, including file sharing, communication, and name system services. It employs strong encryption and focuses on preventing censorship and surveillance.

(GNUnet 2023; Srivathsav 2018.)

#### Differences:

Focus: Each network has a different primary focus, whether it's anonymous communication, content sharing, or decentralized web hosting.

Technology Stack: The underlying technologies vary, from onion routing to garlic routing, blockchain, and cryptographic techniques.

Use Cases: While some networks are designed for general-purpose anonymity, others cater to specific use cases like decentralized web hosting or private communication.

#### Similarities:
Decentralization: Most of these networks aim to be decentralized to prevent a single point of failure or control.

Censorship Resistance: Commonly, these networks share a goal of resisting censorship, whether it's in communication or content distribution.

Encryption: Strong encryption is a shared feature to protect user data and communications.

In summary, the differences and benefits of these networks are rooted in their specific goals, technologies employed, and the architectural decisions made to achieve those goals. Users should choose a network based on their specific needs, whether it's for private communication, content sharing, or other applications requiring anonymity or pseudonymity.
