##### 2.5 Communications Using Public-Key Cryptography
This section introduces public-key cryptography, explaining the computational difficulty of deducing the private key from the public key. It outlines the secure communication process between Alice and Bob using public-key cryptography, addressing key-management issues. The limitations of public-key algorithms and the use of hybrid cryptosystems are discussed, concluding with a historical note on Ralph Merkle's contributions to public-key cryptography.

##### 2.6 Digital Signatures
This passage explores digital signatures for ensuring the authenticity of electronic documents. It compares digital signatures to handwritten signatures, discusses signing protocols using symmetric and public-key cryptography, and emphasizes the role of trusted entities and timestamps. Practical implementations and applications of digital signatures, including their proposal for verifying nuclear test ban treaties, are covered.

##### 2.7 Digital Signatures With Encryption
This passage introduces a protocol combining digital signatures with public-key cryptography for secure electronic communication. It explains the process of signing a message with a private key, encrypting it with the recipient's public key, and the reverse decryption and verification steps. The importance of signing before encrypting, potential attacks, obtaining public keys securely, and the role of a Key Certification Authority (KDC) are discussed.

##### 2.8 Random And Pseudo-Random-Sequence Generation
This passage discusses the inadequacy of typical random-number generators for cryptographic purposes. It introduces pseudo-random sequences, emphasizing the need for cryptographic security with properties like unpredictability. The distinction between cryptographic pseudo-random sequences and genuinely random sequences is explored, highlighting the challenge of verifying true randomness in cryptographic applications.

### Rosenbaum 2019 (Typical use of digital signatures to Private key security)

##### Digital Signatures in Email
- Digital signatures are used to ensure the integrity of email attachments, such as cat pictures.
- The process involves private key generation, sharing the public key with the recipient (Fred), and signing the email for verification using the public key.

##### Enhancing Cookie Token Security
- Individuals like John improve cookie token security by digitally signing token transfers.
- Key pair generation, private key secrecy, and public key sharing with Lisa ensure the integrity of token transfers during purchases.

##### Key Pair Generation and Security
- John generates a key pair with a private key (256-bit random number) stored securely and a derived public key given to Lisa.
- Public-key derivation, a one-way function, ensures the security of digital signatures.

##### Two Uses of Key Pair
- Public and private keys serve dual roles in encryption/decryption and digital signatures.
- Encryption/decryption involves public key encryption for private communication, while digital signatures use the private key to sign and the public key to verify.

##### Digital Signatures Process
- John digitally signs a payment message using his private key.
- The process involves hashing the message with SHA256 and encrypting the hash with John's private key to create a secure digital signature.

##### Signatures in Bitcoin and Private Key Security
- Bitcoin transactions use signatures for authentication.
- If John's private key is compromised, mitigation involves creating a new key pair and updating the public key with Lisa, stressing the importance of securing private keys to prevent unauthorized transactions.

### Karvinen 2023
This article provides a comprehensive guide on using PGP encryption with the 'gpg' tool to send secure messages over the Internet. It covers key generation, trust establishment, and the process of sending and decrypting encrypted messages. The tutorial includes command-line instructions, key management, and emphasizes the importance of verifying public keys for secure communication.

## a) Pubkey today

Secure Communication (SSL/TLS): When I access a website that starts with "https://" instead of "http://," it indicates that the connection is secured using SSL/TLS protocols. Public key cryptography is a fundamental component of these protocols.

Digital Signatures: Digital signatures, which use public key cryptography, are used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital documents. For example, when I sign a agreement at work digitally, I use my private key to create a unique signature. Others can verify this signature using my public key, ensuring that the document has not been altered and was indeed signed by me.

Online Banking and Transactions: Public key cryptography plays a crucial role in securing online banking transactions and other financial activities. When I make a secure online payment or access my bank account, the communication is often encrypted using public key cryptography, preventing unauthorized access to my financial information.
