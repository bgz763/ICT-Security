### Schneier 2015
##### 2.5 Communications Using Public-Key Cryptography
This section introduces public-key cryptography, explaining the computational difficulty of deducing the private key from the public key. It outlines the secure communication process between Alice and Bob using public-key cryptography, addressing key-management issues. The limitations of public-key algorithms and the use of hybrid cryptosystems are discussed, concluding with a historical note on Ralph Merkle's contributions to public-key cryptography.

##### 2.6 Digital Signatures
This passage explores digital signatures for ensuring the authenticity of electronic documents. It compares digital signatures to handwritten signatures, discusses signing protocols using symmetric and public-key cryptography, and emphasizes the role of trusted entities and timestamps. Practical implementations and applications of digital signatures, including their proposal for verifying nuclear test ban treaties, are covered.

##### 2.7 Digital Signatures With Encryption
This passage introduces a protocol combining digital signatures with public-key cryptography for secure electronic communication. It explains the process of signing a message with a private key, encrypting it with the recipient's public key, and the reverse decryption and verification steps. The importance of signing before encrypting, potential attacks, obtaining public keys securely, and the role of a Key Certification Authority (KDC) are discussed.

##### 2.8 Random And Pseudo-Random-Sequence Generation
This passage discusses the inadequacy of typical random-number generators for cryptographic purposes. It introduces pseudo-random sequences, emphasizing the need for cryptographic security with properties like unpredictability. The distinction between cryptographic pseudo-random sequences and genuinely random sequences is explored, highlighting the challenge of verifying true randomness in cryptographic applications.

### Rosenbaum 2019 (Typical use of digital signatures to Private key security)

##### Typical use of digital signatures
To ensure the integrity of a cat picture sent via email, a digital signature is employed in three steps. In preparation, a private key is generated, and a corresponding public key is shared with the recipient, Fred. The sender then signs the email and attached picture using the private key. Fred, using the public key, verifies the signature, ensuring the picture's authenticity and integrity.

##### Improving cookie token security
To enhance cookie token security, individuals like John can digitally sign their token transfers. John generates a key pair, keeps the private key secret, and shares the public key with Lisa. When making a purchase, John signs a message with his private key, and Lisa verifies it using the public key. This process ensures the integrity of token transfers.

#### Key Pair Generation
John generates a key pair consisting of a private key and a derived public key.
The private key, a 256-bit random number, is stored on John's hard drive, while the public key is given to Lisa.
Public-key derivation is a one-way function, ensuring the security of digital signatures.

#### Two Uses of Key Pair
Public and private keys are utilized for encryption and decryption.
The left side of the process involves encrypting with the public key and decrypting with the private key, ensuring private communication.
The right side is used for digital signatures, where the private key signs a message, and the public key verifies the signature.

#### Digital Signatures Process
John digitally signs a payment message to the cafe using his private key.
The signing process involves hashing the message with SHA256 and encrypting the hash with John's private key.
The resulting digital signature is a secure identifier of the signed message.

#### Recap of Key Pairs and Digital Signatures
Private keys are used to encrypt messages that can only be decrypted with the corresponding public key.
Digital signatures involve hashing a message and encrypting the hash with the private key for verification using the public key.
The process is unsuitable for sending secret messages due to the widely known public key. Bitcoin primarily uses digital signatures for transaction verification.

### Karvinen 2023
This article provides a comprehensive guide on using PGP encryption with the 'gpg' tool to send secure messages over the Internet. It covers key generation, trust establishment, and the process of sending and decrypting encrypted messages. The tutorial includes command-line instructions, key management, and emphasizes the importance of verifying public keys for secure communication.

## a) Pubkey today

Secure Communication (SSL/TLS): When I access a website that starts with "https://" instead of "http://," it indicates that the connection is secured using SSL/TLS protocols. Public key cryptography is a fundamental component of these protocols.

Digital Signatures: Digital signatures, which use public key cryptography, are used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital documents. For example, when I sign a agreement at work digitally, I use my private key to create a unique signature. Others can verify this signature using my public key, ensuring that the document has not been altered and was indeed signed by me.

Online Banking and Transactions: Public key cryptography plays a crucial role in securing online banking transactions and other financial activities. When I make a secure online payment or access my bank account, the communication is often encrypted using public key cryptography, preventing unauthorized access to my financial information.
