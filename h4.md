Karvinen 2023: This article provides a comprehensive guide on using PGP encryption with the 'gpg' tool to send secure messages over the Internet. It covers key generation, trust establishment, and the process of sending and decrypting encrypted messages. The tutorial includes command-line instructions, key management, and emphasizes the importance of verifying public keys for secure communication.

## a) Pubkey today

Secure Communication (SSL/TLS): When I access a website that starts with "https://" instead of "http://," it indicates that the connection is secured using SSL/TLS protocols. Public key cryptography is a fundamental component of these protocols.

Digital Signatures: Digital signatures, which use public key cryptography, are used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital documents. For example, when I sign a agreement at work digitally, I use my private key to create a unique signature. Others can verify this signature using my public key, ensuring that the document has not been altered and was indeed signed by me.

Online Banking and Transactions: Public key cryptography plays a crucial role in securing online banking transactions and other financial activities. When I make a secure online payment or access my bank account, the communication is often encrypted using public key cryptography, preventing unauthorized access to my financial information.
