2.5 Communications Using Public-Key Cryptography

The text discusses public-key cryptography introduced by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976. Unlike symmetric algorithms, public-key cryptography uses two keysâ€”one public and one private. Public keys encrypt messages, and only the corresponding private key can decrypt them.

2.6 Digital Signatures

The text discusses digital signatures, comparing them to traditional signatures and explaining their characteristics. It also delves into the role of timestamps and one-way hash functions in enhancing security and efficiency. In addition on topic is the applications of digital signatures, emphasizing their importance in ensuring the integrity of information.

2.7 Digital Signatures With Encryption

The topic of the one passage discusses the integration of digital signatures with public-key cryptography for secure electronic communication. The text emphasizes the importance of signing before encrypting.

2.8 Random And Pseudo-Random-Sequence Generation

The text discusses the challenges of using random-number generators in cryptography. Conventional generators are often insecure, as their outputs can exhibit patterns and predictability. Pseudo-random-sequence generators attempt to mimic randomness but may still have vulnerabilities.

This article provides a comprehensive guide on using PGP encryption with the 'gpg' tool to send secure messages over the Internet. It covers key generation, trust establishment, and the process of sending and decrypting encrypted messages. The tutorial includes command-line instructions, key management, and emphasizes the importance of verifying public keys for secure communication.

## a) Pubkey today

Secure Communication (SSL/TLS): When I access a website that starts with "https://" instead of "http://," it indicates that the connection is secured using SSL/TLS protocols. Public key cryptography is a fundamental component of these protocols.

Digital Signatures: Digital signatures, which use public key cryptography, are used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital documents. For example, when I sign a agreement at work digitally, I use my private key to create a unique signature. Others can verify this signature using my public key, ensuring that the document has not been altered and was indeed signed by me.

Online Banking and Transactions: Public key cryptography plays a crucial role in securing online banking transactions and other financial activities. When I make a secure online payment or access my bank account, the communication is often encrypted using public key cryptography, preventing unauthorized access to my financial information.
