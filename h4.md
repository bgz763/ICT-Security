2.5 Communications Using Public-Key Cryptography

This section introduces public-key cryptography as a groundbreaking paradigm shift, using the analogy of a cryptographic safe turned into a mailbox. The computational difficulty of deducing the private key from the public key is explained, emphasizing the security of public-key systems. The process of secure communication between Alice and Bob using public-key cryptography is outlined, addressing the key-management problem. The limitations of public-key algorithms in terms of speed and vulnerability to chosen-plaintext attacks are discussed. Hybrid cryptosystems, combining public-key and symmetric cryptography, are presented as a practical solution to key distribution issues. The section concludes with a historical note on Ralph Merkle's contribution to public-key cryptography and an explanation of his puzzles for secure communication over insecure channels.

2.6 Digital Signatures

This passage explores digital signatures as a means of ensuring the authenticity, unforgeability, and non-repudiation of electronic documents. It begins by comparing digital signatures to handwritten signatures, highlighting the challenges and benefits of each. The passage then delves into various protocols for signing documents using symmetric and public-key cryptography, emphasizing the importance of trusted entities and the role of timestamps. It also discusses practical implementations, including the use of one-way hash functions to enhance efficiency. The concept of non-repudiation, potential abuses, and the role of timestamps in mitigating such issues are explored. The passage concludes with applications of digital signatures, including their early proposal for verifying nuclear test ban treaties.

2.7 Digital Signatures With Encryption

This passage introduces a protocol combining digital signatures with public-key cryptography for secure electronic communication. It explains the process of signing a message with a private key, encrypting it with the recipient's public key, and the reverse decryption and verification steps. The text emphasizes the importance of signing before encrypting for security and legal reasons. Additionally, it discusses potential attacks and countermeasures, such as using different keys for encryption and signatures or employing timestamps. The passage also touches on obtaining public keys securely from databases and the role of a Key Certification Authority (KDC) in preventing substitution attacks during transmission.

2.8 Random And Pseudo-Random-Sequence Generation

This passage discusses the inadequacy of typical random-number generators for cryptographic purposes due to predictability and periodicity. It introduces pseudo-random sequences, emphasizing the need for cryptographic security with properties like unpredictability and resistance to attack. The distinction between cryptographic pseudo-random sequences and genuinely random sequences, which are unreproducible, is explored, highlighting the challenge of verifying true randomness in cryptographic applications.

This article provides a comprehensive guide on using PGP encryption with the 'gpg' tool to send secure messages over the Internet. It covers key generation, trust establishment, and the process of sending and decrypting encrypted messages. The tutorial includes command-line instructions, key management, and emphasizes the importance of verifying public keys for secure communication.

## a) Pubkey today

Secure Communication (SSL/TLS): When I access a website that starts with "https://" instead of "http://," it indicates that the connection is secured using SSL/TLS protocols. Public key cryptography is a fundamental component of these protocols.

Digital Signatures: Digital signatures, which use public key cryptography, are used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital documents. For example, when I sign a agreement at work digitally, I use my private key to create a unique signature. Others can verify this signature using my public key, ensuring that the document has not been altered and was indeed signed by me.

Online Banking and Transactions: Public key cryptography plays a crucial role in securing online banking transactions and other financial activities. When I make a secure online payment or access my bank account, the communication is often encrypted using public key cryptography, preventing unauthorized access to my financial information.
