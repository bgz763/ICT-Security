### Protocol Building Blocks
- Cryptography aims to address issues related to secrecy, authentication, integrity, and trust in the presence of dishonest individuals. Protocols play a crucial role in applying cryptographic solutions to practical problems.
- A protocol is a defined series of steps involving two or more parties, designed to achieve a specific task. Protocols must be well-known, agreed upon by all parties, unambiguous, and complete. Cryptographic protocols, specifically, utilize cryptography to enable secure communication and collaboration between parties, ensuring prevention or detection of eavesdropping and cheating.
- The purpose of protocols is to provide formalized procedures for tasks, especially in the context of computer networks where face-to-face interaction is absent. Unlike informal protocols in daily life, computer protocols ensure fairness, security, and functionality in a less flexible environment. By formalizing protocols, we can analyze and protect against potential subversion by dishonest parties, making it possible to implement secure and consistent procedures across various technologies.
- The article presented three different protocols; Arbitrated Protocols, Adjudicated Protocols and Self-Enforcing Protocols. **Arbitrated Protocols** involve a neutral arbitrator, like a lawyer, trusted by parties with no mutual trust. They complete protocols, ensuring fairness. **Adjudicated protocols** involve nonarbitrated and arbitrated subprotocols. Adjudicators, like judges, intervene only in disputes, ensuring fair protocol execution and detecting cheating in computer protocols. **Self-enforcing protocols** ensure fairness without arbitrators or adjudicators. Unfortunately, not applicable to every situation.
- In the context of cryptographic protocols, attacks can target algorithms, implementation techniques, or the protocols themselves. Passive attacks involve eavesdropping to observe and gain information, while active attacks aim to alter protocols for personal gain. These attacks can be serious, especially when parties don't fully trust each other. Detecting and preventing such attacks are crucial for protocol security
