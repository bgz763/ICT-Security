### Protocol Building Blocks
- Cryptography aims to address issues related to secrecy, authentication, integrity, and trust in the presence of dishonest individuals. Protocols play a crucial role in applying cryptographic solutions to practical problems.
- A protocol is a defined series of steps involving two or more parties, designed to achieve a specific task. Protocols must be well-known, agreed upon by all parties, unambiguous, and complete. Cryptographic protocols, specifically, utilize cryptography to enable secure communication and collaboration between parties, ensuring prevention or detection of eavesdropping and cheating.
- The purpose of protocols is to provide formalized procedures for tasks, especially in the context of computer networks where face-to-face interaction is absent. Unlike informal protocols in daily life, computer protocols ensure fairness, security, and functionality in a less flexible environment. By formalizing protocols, we can analyze and protect against potential subversion by dishonest parties, making it possible to implement secure and consistent procedures across various technologies.
