## Protocol Building Blocks
1. Purpose of Cryptography: Cryptography aims to solve problems related to secrecy, authentication, integrity, and dishonesty, which is also the fundamental purpose of computers.

2. Introduction to Protocols: Protocols are series of steps involving two or more parties designed to achieve a task. They have a defined sequence, involve multiple participants, and are designed with a specific purpose in mind.

3. Characteristics of Protocols:

- All involved parties must know and agree to follow the protocol.
- The protocol must be unambiguous and complete, with specified actions for every situation.
- Execution proceeds linearly through steps, involving computations or messages among parties.
- Cryptographic Protocols: These use cryptography and involve parties with varying levels of trust. The goal goes beyond secrecy, including sharing secrets, identity verification, or simultaneous contract signing. - - 
- Cryptography in protocols aims to prevent eavesdropping and cheating.

4. Challenges and Importance: Ensuring that no more is done than specified in the protocol is challenging. The upcoming chapters discuss various protocols, some vulnerable to cheating or eavesdropping. Failures can result from inadequate requirements or analysis. Proving insecurity is easier than proving security.
