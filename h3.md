### Protocol Building Blocks
- Cryptography aims to address issues related to secrecy, authentication, integrity, and trust in the presence of dishonest individuals. Protocols play a crucial role in applying cryptographic solutions to practical problems.
- A protocol is a defined series of steps involving two or more parties, designed to achieve a specific task. Protocols must be well-known, agreed upon by all parties, unambiguous, and complete.
- The purpose of protocols is to provide formalized procedures for tasks, especially in the context of computer networks where face-to-face interaction is absent. Unlike informal protocols in daily life, computer protocols ensure fairness, security, and functionality in a less flexible environment.
- The article presented three different protocols; Arbitrated Protocols, Adjudicated Protocols and Self-Enforcing Protocols. **Arbitrated Protocols** involve a neutral arbitrator, like a lawyer, trusted by parties with no mutual trust. They complete protocols, ensuring fairness. **Adjudicated protocols** involve nonarbitrated and arbitrated subprotocols. Adjudicators, like judges, intervene only in disputes, ensuring fair protocol execution and detecting cheating in computer protocols. **Self-enforcing protocols** ensure fairness without arbitrators or adjudicators. Unfortunately, not applicable to every situation.
- Attacks against protocols can target algorithms, implementation techniques, or the protocols themselves. Passive attacks involve eavesdropping to observe and gain information, while active attacks aim to alter protocols for personal gain.
- Symmetric cryptography involves secure communication between two parties. They agree on a cryptosystem and a secret key. As described in the article, Alice encrypts her message, creating ciphertext, which Bob decrypts using the key. Symmetric systems require secret key distribution, risk if keys are compromised, and scalability issues as users increase. Public-key cryptography addresses some challenges, but symmetric systems demand careful key management.
- One-way functions are crucial in public-key cryptography, serving as a foundation for protocols. They're easy to compute but challenging to reverse. While not directly usable for encryption, trapdoor one-way functions, with secret trapdoors, offer a solution.
- A one-way hash function, essential in modern cryptography, transforms input into a fixed-length output, providing a fingerprint for data integrity verification. While easily computed in one direction, it's challenging to reverse, ensuring security.
- The text discusses public-key cryptography introduced by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976. Unlike symmetric algorithms, public-key cryptography uses two keysâ€”one public and one private. Public keys encrypt messages, and only the corresponding private key can decrypt them.
- The text discusses digital signatures, comparing them to traditional signatures and explaining their characteristics. It also delves into the role of timestamps and one-way hash functions in enhancing security and efficiency. In addition on topic is the applications of digital signatures, emphasizing their importance in ensuring the integrity of information.
- The topic of the one passage discusses the integration of digital signatures with public-key cryptography for secure electronic communication. The text emphasizes the importance of signing before encrypting.
- The text discusses the challenges of using random-number generators in cryptography. Conventional generators are often insecure, as their outputs can exhibit patterns and predictability. Pseudo-random-sequence generators attempt to mimic randomness but may still have vulnerabilities.
